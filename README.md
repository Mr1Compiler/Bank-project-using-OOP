# 🏦 Bank System (C++, OOP, Console-Based)

## 📌 About the Project  
This **Bank System** is a fully functional **console-based application** developed in **C++** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. It simulates real-world banking operations, including **user authentication, account management, transactions, and currency exchange**. The system uses **text files** for data storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.


## ✨ Features  
✔ **User Authentication** – Secure login system for users and administrators.  
✔ **Account Management** – Create, update, and delete client accounts.  
✔ **Transaction Management** – Deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds between accounts.  
✔ **Currency Exchange** – View and update exchange rates, calculate conversions.  
✔ **User Management** – Add, delete, update, and list system users with different access levels.  
✔ **Transaction Logs** – Track all transfers and transactions.  
✔ **Client Search & Filtering** – Find users and clients efficiently.  
✔ **Balance Overview** – Display total bank balances across all accounts.  
✔ **File-Based Data Storage** – Uses text files (`Clients.txt`, `Users.txt`, etc.) for persistent data storage.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
🔹 **C++** – Core language for development  
🔹 **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** – Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism  
🔹 **File Handling** – Text files for data persistence  
🔹 **Modular Code Structure** – Organized into classes for maintainability
